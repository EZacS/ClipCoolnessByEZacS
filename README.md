Rate the coolness of your clips - for free!

Idea from FranzJ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFKs7faSBAU)

Made by [@Evla03](https://github.com/Evla03) and [@EZacS](https://github.com/EZacS)

We changed the project name and didn't bother to fix it :) So you might se clipcoolness in some places.
Crap code :DD
